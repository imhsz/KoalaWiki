      1. REPOSITORY ASSESSMENT:
         - Analyze the README content to determine repository purpose, scope, and target audience
         - Identify core technologies, frameworks, languages, and dependencies
         - Recognize architectural patterns, design principles, and system organization
         - Map key components and their relationships within the codebase
      
      2. DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE PLANNING:
         - Select the optimal documentation structure based on repository type and complexity
         - Design a logical hierarchy from high-level concepts to implementation details
         - Identify critical sections needed for this specific codebase
         - Determine appropriate depth and technical detail for each section
      
      3. CONTENT DEVELOPMENT:
         - For each documentation section:
           * Extract relevant components from the codebase
           * Analyze dependencies and interaction patterns
           * Document APIs, interfaces, functions, and data structures
           * Capture implementation details, algorithms, and design patterns
           * Include usage examples and integration guidelines
      
      4. DOCUMENTATION REFINEMENT:
         - Ensure consistent terminology and formatting throughout
         - Verify technical accuracy and completeness
         - Balance technical precision with accessibility
         - Organize content for both sequential reading and reference lookup

      <output_requirements>
      Generate a comprehensive documentation directory tree structure following a logical progression:
      
      1. Start with overview and conceptual information
      2. Continue with installation and setup guides
      3. Document core functionality and features
      4. Detail API/interface specifications
      5. Cover advanced usage and customization options
      6. Include troubleshooting and reference materials
      
      Each section in the directory structure must:
      - Connect to relevant components identified in the repository
      - Reference specific technologies and patterns found in the codebase
      - Include detailed subsection breakdowns
      - Specify content requirements for code examples
      - Provide guidelines for documenting interfaces and parameters
      - Include requirements for architectural diagrams where appropriate
      - Maintain consistent terminology aligned with repository conventions
      - Follow a progressive disclosure approach (basic to advanced)
      
      For each major component:
      - Document its purpose and system relationship
      - Cover interfaces, methods, and implementation details
      - Describe usage patterns and integration points
      - Map dependencies and interactions
      - Explain configuration and customization options
      - Include troubleshooting guidance
      
      The directory structure must balance repository organization with user-centric information architecture. All content must be derived exclusively from the provided repository context.

# Comprehensive Project Analysis Framework

## 1. Project Structure Analysis
- Identify core components and map their relationships
- Document code organization principles and design patterns
- Generate visual representation of project architecture
- Analyze file distribution and module organization

## 2. Configuration Management
- Examine environment configuration files and variables
- Review build system and deployment configuration
- Document external service integration points and dependencies
- Identify configuration patterns and potential improvements

## 3. Dependency Analysis
- List external dependencies with version requirements
- Map internal module dependencies and coupling patterns
- Generate project management dependencies using the Mermaid syntax in Markdown
- Highlight critical dependencies and potential vulnerabilities

## 4. Project-Specific Analysis
- [FRAMEWORK]: Analyze framework-specific patterns and implementation

- [CUSTOM]: Identify project-specific patterns and architectural decisions
- [PERFORMANCE]: Assess performance considerations unique to this project

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations
- Summarize project architecture and key characteristics
- Identify architectural strengths and potential improvement areas
- Provide actionable recommendations for enhancing code organization
- Outline next steps for project evolution and maintenance
</analysis_structure>


PHASE 2: CATALOGUE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
Input source:
<catalogue>
{{$catalogue}}
</catalogue>


<section_adaptation>
Dynamically adjust analysis based on detected project characteristics:
- For **frontend projects**: Include UI component hierarchy, state management, and routing analysis
- For **backend services**: Analyze API structure, data flow, and service boundaries
- For **data-intensive applications**: Examine data models, transformations, and storage patterns
- For **monorepos**: Map cross-project dependencies and shared utility usage
</section_adaptation>

PHASE 3: DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS
For each key file identified in PHASE 2:
1. Read and analyze the content of main entry points
2. Examine core module implementations
3. Review configuration files
4. Analyze dependency specifications

IMPORTANT: For each file you identify as important from the catalogue:
- Request its content using system functions
- Include specific code snippets in your analysis
- Connect file implementations to the project's overall architecture
- Identify how components interact with each other


Source Reference Guidelines:
- For each code file you read and analyze, include a reference link at the end of the related section
- Format source references using this pattern: 
  Sources:
  - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file)
- The git_repository value combined with the file path creates the complete source URL
- This helps readers trace information back to the original source code
- Include these references after each major section where you've analyzed specific files

## Syntax Format
To reference specific code lines from a file in a Git repository, use the following format:

Sources:
   - [filename](git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)

## Components
- `[filename]`: The display name for the linked file
- `(git_repository_url/path/to/file#L1-L10)`: The URL with line selection parameters
  - `git_repository_url`: The base URL of the Git repository
  - `/path/to/file`: The file path within the repository
  - `#L1-L10`: Line selection annotation
    - `L1`: Starting line number
    - `L10`: Ending line number
    
</analysis_phases>

- Brackets cannot be directly used in the label of mermaid's flowchart node. It can be replaced by other symbols (such as brackets, dashes, newlines, etc.)
- For example, E[外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)]  should be changed to E[""外部系统(RMS/BPM/PSA)""]
- For example, E --|数据库/缓存|  should be changed to E -->|数据库/缓存| , and -- 实现 --> should be changed to --|实现|-->
- The subgraph should be in English, for example  subgraph 工厂与事件处理 should be changed to subgraph FactoryAndEventHandler  and The end must be followed by a blank line or a new line, and cannot be directly followed by other content
- RedisCache --> ""ICache"" in classDiagram should be RedisCache --> ICache
